On LLMs-Driven Synthetic Data Generation, Curation, and Evaluation: A Survey

#### Data Generation
(1) ASSUME THE DATA FROM LLM ARE AS SEED SAMPLES

- Best Practices and Lessons Learned on Synthetic Data
- Generating Faithful Synthetic Data with Large Language Models: A Case Study in Computational Social Science

(2-a) Generation by Data Augmentation
(2-b) Generation by Model Distillation
(2-c) Generation by Prompting 

- Synthetic data generation method for data-free knowledge distillation in regression neural networks

#### Curation

- High quality sample filtering
- Label enhancement

#### Evaluation

- Requirements of D_gen
  - Faithfulness
the generated data must first be logically and grammatically coherent.
itâ€™s a well-supported observation about large language models (LLMs) that their knowledge distribution exhibits fat-tailed characteristics

  - Diversity

- Data Evaluation Methods
  - Direct Evaluation
  - INDirect Evaluation
